// The premise:
In order to save time for many officers in our fraternity, I'd like to make a FB Messenger bot that:
Sends event reminders for the fraternity
Sends chore reminders for residents
Node backend + MongoDB + FB Messenger API + Google Calendar API.
Also create some kind of interface for officers to send their custom reminders? Not too sure how 
involved this would be- would like some pointers.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Right so this is the app i'd like to do: 

/**Backend**/
Sign in/Sign out for officers. We'd have to create a user and officer model for this.
  (Express + MongoDB)
  (Note: Members vs Officers)
  ooh or look into signing in with google account????

Allow Officers to create events.
  possibly look towards linking with Google Drive.
  (though, google drive events will be from me.)


(Create user, with permission from me.)

/** FrontEnd **/
Having a fluid one-page app for signing in, making events, having a visualization of said events? 
We're gonna react the shit out of that innit.

/*** Models ***/
Users:
  id
  First Name
  Last Name
  isOfficer

Events:
  belongs_to User
  Created Time
  Happening Time
  Title
  Description
  Location

/*** Views ***/
Really tempted for react, possibly backbone? React sounds better for dev imho.


/// afterthoughts
(and remember, this is primarily for me- i should make this a gammaboard. but we'll see.)

Every event- send with prefabricated message using FB messenger (or possibly twilio)

So a few curiosities:
  1) FB Messenger bot??? Will this work? Do some reading. Else, do some twilio.
  2) How the FUCK do you use MongoDB?

// But yeah that's our core app: a thing that people can sign into and do FB automated things.


Also as a bonus- we can do the attendance thing where we can create attendence models.
  we can even look into doing data visualization throughout time.
^^ i'm gonna react the shit out of that. 


So yeah general goals:
Get the MVP done tomorrow LMFAO
No by that I mean get Mongo up, get sign in/signout done, and get users are able to make posts done.
This should not take that long- this is incredibly basic af.
